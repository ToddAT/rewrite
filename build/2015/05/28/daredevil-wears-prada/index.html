<p><strong>SPOILER WARNING:</strong> <em>Don't read any further if you don't want to be spoiled about the Daredevil season. You have been warned.</em></p>

<p>My main reservations focus on the deaths of major characters, both good and bad, in the lead-up to the final showdown. To put it bluntly, I was disappointed that the writers chose to kill off so many interesting characters that had been developed over the course of the season.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest of these was the killing of Ben Urich. Urich was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Urich">a major figure in the comics</a> that the show spent a good deal of time fleshing out. It seemed a waste to kill him so early in the show's timeline. And not to be that racial guy but let me be that racial guy– Urich was the only major player of color and he didn't even make it out of the first season.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Like Urich, Leland Owlsley was also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl_(Marvel_Comics)">a major comic book presence</a>. On top of that, they gave him some great dry wit which was a nice relief from the other stoic or simmering with rage evildoers. Now, I will fully admit that I'm not 100% sure that Owlsley is dead. The fall he took was not no-brainer fatal and nobody mentions his death after it happens. It could be, and I hope it is, that he reemerges in a future season. That said, his final confrontation with Fisk displayed a lack of intelligence that had been Owlsley's strength: you're really going to go with Fisk alone into a dark alley with just that silly tazer? And then you just give up everything straight up? C'mon.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I was sorry to see James Wesley go. He was a great henchman with some nuance, not just either blind canine loyalty or overwelming moustache-twirling evil or just plain bat-shit insanity<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. I would have liked to seen how he dealt with Fisk's incarceration: would he stay loyal? Would he try to maintain the hegemony?</p>

<p>One of the show's strengths was demonstrating the <em>messiness</em> of the criminal world– all these different forces intertwined, held together by mutual interest, money, and powerful personalities. It was disappointing then to have the writers appear to tie things off so neatly and write off elements that they had spent the past thirteen episodes describing so well. I'm sure new characters will appear to fill the breaches but they'll be hard-pressed to improve upon what came before. It's a testament to the show that there were so many characters that I enjoyed watching, on both sides of the good-bad divide.</p>

<p>The last thing I'd like to touch on is the portrayal of Hell's Kitchen, something I think the show did an excellent job with. I live in New York City so I recognized a number of the locations that they used and none of the ones I recognized were from the real Hell's Kitchen. I know I saw some Williamsburg (Brooklyn) in there, at least one spot in Tribeca. I'm sure there are more I'm forgetting. The point is that the show was able to create a Hell's Kitchen that was both authentically New York and strange and unique at the same time, much like comic book New York, that's both rooted in the real city and something else altogether.</p>

<p>I'm not a big fan of shows that wipe the slate clean at the end of every season. I like my shows messier (<em>The Wire</em> was masterful at this). In that sense, I was disappointed that <em>Daredevil</em> chose to clear the decks so neatly after investing in such a dynamic morass of a neighborhood on the brink. That said, I love what they did with that neighborhood and the city visually, I thought the acting was top-notch, and the action choreography fun and exciting. They've certainly built in enough hooks for expanding the series down the line and I look forward to seeing where they take it.</p>

<p>I do think that they could have done with compressing things a bit, as I said at the top, my interest was flagging towards the end. I think maybe ten or eleven episodes could have done the job instead of thirteen. Alternatively, perhaps next time they could introduce some other minor villains to break things up a bit. Like I said, they've got options. Though I think that they uneccesarily cut some short with the choices that they made.</p>

      <p>I think there were other options too. What about killing off his ailing wife instead? It's a great tit-for-tat for Fisk's mother and can drive Urich temporarily out of the picture for the finale and give him a character-redefining moment. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
